        <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
        <p>
            SHEcycle empowers college women to create a more sustainable, cost-effective wardrobe by connecting
            on-campus
            communities to swap, donate, and earn credit for gently used clothing. Our mission is to combat the
            overconsumption
            crisis and reduce the millions of clothing that end up in landfills each year. We believe in a sustainable
            future
            where style doesn’t come at the expense of the planet. College-aged women make up a high percentage of fast
            fashion
            consumers. By making college campuses our target audience, SHEcycle offers an eco-friendly alternative to
            fast
            fashion while supporting female empowerment and building a more sustainable future.

        <p class="motto">Swap ⋅ Style ⋅ Sustain</p>
        <p class="motto-desc">Our motto embodies our mission to transform the way we approach fashion in
            efforts
            to reduce the harmful waste to the environment.

        <h2>Impact Statement</h2>
        <p>
            At SHEcycle, we’re actively working to reduce the waste generated by fast fashion—one piece of clothing at a
            time.
            Studies show that about 41% of young women feel pressured to not wear the same outfit twice, which makes
            fast fashion's
            cheap options particularly appealing. However, this trend comes at a heavy environmental cost. The average
            American
            consumer discards 81.5 pounds of clothing every year, much of which ends up in landfills, where it can take
            years to
            decompose. Worse, synthetic fabrics like polyester—commonly found in fast fashion—are not biodegradable.
        </p>
        <p>
            The fashion industry is the second largest polluter globally, contributing to more carbon emissions than all
            international flights and maritime shipping combined. At SHEcycle, we’re committed to lessening the harmful
            impacts
            of fast fashion by providing sustainable alternatives. By highlighting the significant environmental toll of
            fast
            fashion, we aim to raise awareness about the importance of eco-conscious choices and demonstrate how
            SHEcycle can
            help reduce waste and promote a more sustainable approach to style.
