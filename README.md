## ♻️ About SHEcycle

SHEcycle is a sustainable fashion marketplace designed to help college women swap, donate, and earn credits for gently used clothing.

With SHEcycle, users can:\
✔ Create an Account – Join a local network of students for fashion swaps.\
✔ Browse & List Items – Find second-hand clothing or list your own gently used pieces.\
✔ Swap or Donate – Trade clothing with others or donate items to earn credits.\
✔ Earn Credits – Donations and successful swaps reward users with credits to get new items.\
